<h1>Penny for your thoughts?</h1>
<p>So there I was again, the same state of mind, confusion, over thinking, maybe a little bit of amusement 
curious as to how everything changed.</p>

<p>3pm and we're sitting together on the longer hand of a clock happy, maybe distant but happy.
Then as time passed the hands moved and so did you, at least I thought you did 
Till I looked up and realised you were still up there and I? I fell.
i fell into the world, I stopped moving and maybe you did aswell but at a different time and a different space 
Together but apart </p>

<p>Then somehow someday, when we're all grown you come back like you never left, expecting me to adjust like before, to follow you 
To pretend that eventually you caught up to me and we moved together as one 
But instead I choose myself this time , and you? like always when I do, you victimise yourself and then I 
ask myself why you do these things </p>

<p>Is it because you think I don't care?
you say the silence didn't move me.
Do you say that because I'm not sobbing or weeping or bawling my eyes out, that you think I don't care
No, you see it's because you put me in a situation where I am so disappointed and angry that I can't even cry.
where I can't even express how I feel because expressing at this point would be chaotic for both us, but of course mostly you considering how all of my attempt and pleas to get you to do something about the situation has been for not 
because to you our problems became a problem to you.</p>

<p>how I hoped every single time that you would understand me,....realise the gravity of your actions and how it's affected me 
but you never did notice because I kept quiet, quiet so I wouldn't have to burden you with emotions I knew you could never show , feelings I knew you would never give to me because you simply didn't have them
you know it wasn't always like this we used to talk it out when it got so bad...but as time passed by, you stopped telling me what went wrong on your end, yes you see you left me... to my thoughts 
thoughts of the worst, that maybe like your other lost interest..I unknowingly added to the list .</p>

<p>That state of urgency that makes one want to try to give their all, to at least act like they actually want to even if they knew they couldn't 
The frustration that comes with it at the end knowing that even if they couldn't they did their best 
But of course you would never understand how that feels because you never did try
Try to make me feel remembered, that you actually do think about me as much as I do 
Heck no, maybe even half of it?
just that much? 
you said you've tried your best as much as you know 
But maybe that's because that's all you want to know. </p>

<p>And then I'm left here wondering just how much you think you've tried...if it's close to how much I would have tried if you let me.
if you let me know you, maybe not as much as you think you know yourself but just enough to understand you .
Then maybe we wouldn't be here 
in this poetic mess </p>.
